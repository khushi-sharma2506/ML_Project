# ML_Project

This repository contains three beginner-to-intermediate machine learning projects, each with example Jupyter notebooks.

## Project List

- **Object Detection Project**
Detects objects in images using deep learning techniques.
- **Landmark Detection Project**
Identifies landmarks and key points in images using neural networks.
- **Text Classification Project**
Classifies text into categories using NLP methods.


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/khushi-sharma2506/ML_Project.git
```


2. Install recommended Python libraries (if needed):

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
# Plus any deep learning or NLP libraries as required by each notebook
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the relevant `.ipynb` files.

## Datasets

- Datasets are **not included**. Please download the datasets from trusted sources (e.g., Kaggle) and update the notebook paths accordingly.
